# Laravel Properties

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/4513/laravel-properties/graph/badge.svg?token=p9C5HsHfsw)](https://codecov.io/gh/4513/laravel-properties)

(Mostly) Prices, VAT, Currencies but also other quantities and their units such as weight, length, area, volume,
time, speed, temperature, etc. are included in this library.

The library focuses on the ability to store, retrieve, calculate, convert, display and do other magic with
quantities and their units.

### Purpose
Beginning with prices and anything related to it:
1. **Creating** a price (**with or without VAT**);
2. Creating a **positive price** (a price that MUST NOT be negative);
3. **Calculating** prices (adding, subtracting);
4. **Converting** prices (to different currencies such as from CZK to EUR);
5. Converting **VAT rate** based on the country (checking VAT rate and its value among different countries);
6. **Displaying** prices (formatting the price to a specific locale and displaying correct currency name or its symbol);
7. Calculating prices with different currencies and/or VAT rates;
8. Working with an **exchange rate**;
9. Using **historical price** (price might have been created a time ago and a different VAT rate and/or value is used);
10. **Storing** price into database with **custom format**;
11. **Retrieving** price from database with custom format;
12. Creating **discounts** based on the provided price-able objects;
13. Retrieving **true VAT value of combined prices**;
14. Ability to have **custom currency** (internal web/app currency);
15. Price **per quantity** (e.g. price per 1 kilogram, piece, etc.);
16. **Full ISO currency** list (one can choose to use all the time updated source);

And to not end with the prices only:
1. Most common **quantities** and their **units** (such as length - meter, mile, inch, etc.);
2. **Converting** units (such as from meter to mile);
3. **SI prefixed** for units (for example kilo, milli);
4. **Metric**, **Imperial**, **US customary**, **SI units**;
5. Calculating quantities (adding, subtracting, **multiplying**, **dividing**);
6. **Derived** quantities (such as speed, acceleration, etc.);
7. **Displaying** quantities using a printer;
8. **Storing** and **retrieving** quantities into database with **custom format**;
9. **Creating** a quantity (**with specified or default unit**);
10. Access to **decimal** property (one can choose number of digits);
11. Access to more precise **float** property (optimized for calculations while thinking about the speed and memory);
12. Ability to **create custom quantity**, units or install additional ones;
13. **Support** for custom **not numerical quantities** (such as clothes size - *inDev*);
14. **Comparing** properties (such as whether are equal, greater, less, between, etc.);

and all of that and more for Laravel framework. Note, that most of these features are accessible out of
this library and can be used in any other PHP project. This library only collects them together and provides
additional features for Laravel and Eloquent, such as attribute casting for database, translations, and others.

### Installation
```bash
composer require mibo/laravel-properties

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MiBo\Prices\Providers\ConfigProvider"
```

 One should first edit the configuration file `prices.php` and add a VAT Resolver and Convertor to be used. Without
them, the prices are zero-able only.

## Schemas
Product has a price.

### Price schemas

Tbl Product (simple price)
* being used when the application uses only one currency and VAT rate is always for the same country;
* VAT category can have a separated column or can be specified within the Model;
* currency is loaded as a default from configuration file.

| Product ID (PK) | Price Value |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 1               | 10          |
| 2               | 10          |

Tbl Product & Tbl Price (multi currency)
* used when the product might have different currencies;
* prices are stored in a separated table;
* VAT category is specified within Product Model and is located within the Product's table;
* applicable for those who sell products in different currencies within the same country.

| Product ID (FK) | Price Value | Currency Code |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1               | 10          | USD           |
| 1               | 20          | CZK           |
| 2               | 10          | USD           |
| 2               | 8           | EUR           |

Tbl Product & Tbl PriceLog
* combinable with both previous schemas;
* used when the application needs to store the price history;
* VAT category can be retrieved correctly by the timestamp of the price change;
* one can use the table to store final price of an entity of a specific time;
* application can use the table as a log of price changes.

| Product ID (FK) | Price Value | Currency Code | Timestamp  |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1               | 10          | USD           | 2019-01-01 |
| 1               | 20          | CZK           | 2019-01-01 |
| 2               | 10          | USD           | 2019-01-01 |
| 2               | 8           | EUR           | 2019-01-01 |
| 1               | 12          | USD           | 2022-01-01 |

Tbl Product w Log inside
* the table contains a timestamp of the creation time of that entity, which is used as a timestamp for VAT;
* applicable for retrieving exact price of a sold product for specified time.

| Product ID (PK) | Price Value | Currency Code | Timestamp   |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1               | 10          | USD           | 2019-01-01  |
| 2               | 10          | USD           | 2019-01-01  |
| 1               | 12          | USD           | 2022-01-01  |

### VAT schemas
Event tho VAT belongs to a price, the VAT is not based on the price (not being meant its value, but the VAT rate).  
The VAT rate is based on the country and the classification of the product. There are many classification
systems and a few of them have a specific categories, so no product changes its category.  
Over a time, the classification category might change its VAT rate and, the VAT rate might change its percentage
value.  
Because of both of the above, the VAT rate is separated from product and price table. That allows us to get
the very true price and its value with VAT for a specific time.  

Tbl VAT

| Category ID (FK) (UK category country) | Country Code (UK category country) | VAT Rate | Timestamp   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| 1                                      | CZ                                 | STANDARD | 2019-01-01  |
| 1                                      | CZ                                 | REDUCED  | 2022-01-01  |
| 2                                      | CZ                                 | 10       | 2019-01-01  |

Tbl VAT Rate
* maximum number of rows within this table is number of countries multiplied by 5 (types of VAT rates) multiplied
  by count of changes of VAT rates for specific country;

| Country Code (PK) | VAT Rate (PK)  | Percentage Value (PK) | Timestamp (PK) |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| CZ                | STANDARD       | 21                    | 2019-01-01     |
| CZ                | REDUCED        | 15                    | 2022-01-01     |
| CZ                | SECOND_REDUCED | 10                    | 2019-01-01     |
| CZ                | NONE           | 0                     | 2019-01-01     |
| SK                | STANDARD       | 20                    | 2019-01-01     |
| SK                | REDUCED        | 10                    | 2019-01-01     |
| SK                | NONE           | 0                     | 2019-01-01     |

Tbl Product
* the table contains a reference to a category classification of the product;
* user might use a product ID as a category ID instead, but that loses the ability to categorize multiple
  products into one category and simply use their shared information.

| Product ID (PK) | Category ID (FK) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 1               | 1                |
| 2               | 2                |
| 3               | 1                |

### Translations
Most (or all) of the properties from library mibo/properties and property of Price have translations in this
library.  
**Note**: *Translations are not being SemVered and any fix of an existing translation, even tho it is changed,
is considered as a patch. New translations (for both, new locale and/or new property) are considered as a minor
change.*

Each property has separated translation file, which is called by the property's quantity's translation name,
specified in `getNameForTranslation()` method. Common return value consists of 'name' key, which is the translated
name of the property, 'units' key, which is a list of available units for the quantity. Each unit is keyed by
its code/symbol. The value contains a 'name' (translated name of the unit for integer value), 'name-float'
(translated name of the unit for float value - some languages have different names for integer and float values),
symbol (symbol of the unit). There is a 'format' key within the property's translation, which contains a format
used to format the value of the property - 'short' and 'long'. The format is used, because some languages have
different formats for e.g. prices ($10 for en_US; 10 $ for cs_CZ).
**Note**: *Format 'short' for Degree Celsius is ignored and (should) always result into 1Â°C (without a space).*
